### What is explicit loading?
>comparing to eager loading, explicit loading happens after the main loading(eager loading happens before the main loading(.Include().Single())). 
>And you can restrict the object you load.

### How to use the explicit loading?
>Use `.Where().Load()` to load the object.
```
var author = context.Author.Single(a => a.Id == 2);

var courses = context.Course.Where(c => c.AuthorId == author.Id).Load();    //expplicit loading and you can restrict the range
```
>If the main object is a list
```
var authors = context.Author.ToList();
var authorIds = authors.Select(a => a.Id);

context.Course.Where(c => authorIds.Contains(c.AuthorId) && c.Price < 10).Load()
```
