### Basic method using
Forward direction:
```
HasMany()
HasRequired()
HasOptional()
```
reverse direction
```
WithMany()
WithRequired()
WithOptional()
```
### How many knid of relationships there are?
>1.one to many
```
modelBuilder.Entity<Author>()
            .HasMany(a => a.Courses)
            .WithRequired(c => c.Author)
            .HasForeignKey(c => c.AuthorID);
```
>2.many to many
```
modelBuilder.Entity<Course>()
            .HasMany(c => c.Tags)
            .WithMany(t => t.Courses)
            .Map(m => m.ToTable("CourseTags"));  //To specify Course and Tag's intermediate table
```
>3.one to zero/one
```
modelBuilder.Entity<Course>()
            .HasOptional(c => c.Caption)
            .WithOptional(c => c.Course);
```
>4.one to one
>It is different that one to one has to set a parent and a child which parent has to be generated firstly.  
>For child -> parent use `WithRequiredPrincipal()`.    
>For parent -> child use `WithRequiredDependent()`    
```
modelBuilder.Entity<Course>()
            .HasRequired(c => c.Cover)
            .WithRequiredPrincipal(c => c.Course); //Cover is child and Course is parent
```
