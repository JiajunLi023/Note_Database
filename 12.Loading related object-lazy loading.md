### What is lazy loading?
>Lazy loading means it can load the object automatically 

### How to set the lazy loading?
>In the main class, set the property which you want to be loaded automatically to virtual.
>for example
```
public class Course
{
    public virtual Author Author { get; set;}
    
    public. virtual ICollection<Tag> Tags { get; set;}

}
```
>Then Author and Tag will be loaded automatically(lazy load)

### How to keep the lazy load off even though the property is virtual
> In Context class's construction do such operation
```
public class PlutoContext : DbContext
{
    public PlutoContext()
          :base("name=PlutoContext")
    {
        this.Configuration.LazyLoadingEnabled = false;
    }
}
```
