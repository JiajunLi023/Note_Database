### How to remove a object?
>1.With cascade delete
```
var course = context.Course.Single(c => c.Id == 1);
context.Course.Remove(course);

context.SaveChanges();
```

>Without cascade delete.   
>For exmaple, we want to delete a author object and in some course objects there are AUthorId which is from author so we cannot delete the author directly.
```
var author = context.Author.Include(a => a.Courses).Single(a => a.Id == 1);
var courses = author.Courses;
context.Course.Remove(courses);
context.Author.Remove(author);

context.SaveChanges();
```

### Better way
>It is better to use logically delete than physically delete.
>Adding a property with IsDeleted()
```
Author.IsDeleted = false/true;
```
