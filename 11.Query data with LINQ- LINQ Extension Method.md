### The method of Extension method
>1.Restriction. 
```
var courses = context.Course.Where(c => c.Level == 1);   //Use .Where() to restrict the context
```
>2.Ordering
```
var courses = context.Course.OrderBy(c => c.Name);  //Use .OrderBy to Order the Context by name
```
>If you want to order the context by multiple property
```
var courses = context.Course.OrderBy(c => c.Name).ThenBy(c => c.Level);
```
>If you want to order by decending way, use`.OrderByDescending()` and `ThenByDescending()`.     

>3.Projection.   
>You can choose to project to the different types or a anonymous object
```
var courses = context.Course.Where(c => c.Level == 1)
                            .OrderBy(c => c.Name)
                            .Select(c => new{CourseName = c.Name AuthorName = c.Author.Name})   //Create a new obejct with CourseName and AuthorName
```
>Or use `.SelectMany()` when the return type is a list   

>4.Set Operators
```
var courses = context.Course.Where(c => c.Level == 1)    //or .Where(c.Name.Contains(".."))
                            .OrderBy(c => c.Name)
                            .SelectMany(c => c.Tags)
                            .Distinct()     // to make there is no same element in courses
```
>5.grouping
```
var groups = context.Course.GroupBy(c => c.Level);    // .GroupBy(Fun,Key)

foreach(var group in groups)
{
    ConsoleWriteLine("Key: ", gourp.Key);
    foreach(var course in group)
    {
        ConsoleWriteLine(course.Name);
    }
}
```
>6.Joins   
>6.1 Inner Joins: When there are not relationships between objects and you want to relate them.   
>If there are no relationship between Course and Author
```
context.Course.Join(context.Author, 
           c => c.AuthorId, 
           a => a.Id, 
           (course, author) => new
           {
              CourseName = course.Name,
              AuthorName = author.Name
           })                        //.join(outer object, inner Key. outer Key, result Object), in the resule object Author-Course(the Author.Id == Course.AuthorId)
```
>6.2 Group Joins
```
context.Authors.GroupJoin(context.Courses, 
           a => a.Id, 
           c => c.AuthorId, 
           (author, courses) => new
           {
              Author = author,
              Courses = courses.Count()
           })                        //
```
>6.3 Cross Joins
```
context.Author.SelectMany(a => context.Course, (author, course) => new
                {
                   AuthorName = author.Name,
                   CourseName = course.Name
                })
